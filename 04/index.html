<center><h1>Week 4: Microcontroller programming</h1></center> 

<p> This weeks assignment was to program an arduino board to do something. In my case, it was the fourth of July weekend and I'm not an on campus student, so I wasn't able to go to the lab at all which was challenging. I had to do most of the assignment on my own and even so I had limited capability. I wrote the code for my program, but I couldn't test it so I had no way of knowing if it worked. However, the next lab I go to I'm planning on completely wrapping up my project. <br> Here's my code!</p>

<pre><code>
int buttonState = digitalRead(8);
const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for A-1A 
const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for A-1B 

void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);    
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {
if (buttonState == HIGH) {
  digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
  delay(3000);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);    
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
} else {
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

}
</code></pre>
