  ### About Me

<p> My name is Emma and I'm a rising junior at Newton North High School, only a couple miles from here! I have 3 pets, 2 cats and 1 dog. I also have an older brother who's going to George Washington University. I decided to take this class because I really wanted to a STEM course that's interesting and fun, and this course fit the bill. I look forward to learning!

  Here's me in Boston!
